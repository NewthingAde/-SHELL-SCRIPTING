# -SHELL-SCRIPTING

Creating Shell Scripting In Linux

This project is to automate some work using Shell Scripts. In other to complete this, we need to onboard 20 new Linux users onto a server. Create a shell script that reads a csv file that contains the first name of the users to be onboarded.

- Create the project folder called Shell and moved into the folder
                        
                        mkdir Shell && cd Shell
                        
- Create a csv file name names.csv and open it

                        touch names.csv && vi names.csv
                        
- Insert some random names into it. (One name per line)
